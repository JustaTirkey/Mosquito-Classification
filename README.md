# Mosquito-Classification
This project presents an AI-based mosquito species recognition system designed to support vector surveillance and public-health monitoring. Using deep learning and computer vision, the system automatically identifies mosquito species from images and videos, enabling faster and scalable detection compared to manual entomological analysis.
